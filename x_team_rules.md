# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
 X team encourages open and a friendly atmosphere in which all team members are expected to contribute to the project. The assigning process will be based on the will and experience level of that group member, i.e experienced ones should be able to handle rather complicated issues rather than beginner ones. However, that does not mean that X -Team doesn't support members who would like to increase their experience level through complicated projects. In a nutshell, we should give the opportunity to any team member who are willing to contribute to that specific assignment.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
X-Team uses social media efficiently as any other developer team should do. We have our own Telegram group which we direct our conversations.
